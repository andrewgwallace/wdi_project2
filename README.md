## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables:

* **Scope.** 
What are you planning to build? 

Everyone has questions they would love to ask but would prefer to ask anonymously. Our app will provide users the answers to the questions they'd rather not ask in public as well as the ability to choose who they'd like answers from. Both asking and answering questions will be done under secret aliases, so neither party has to worry about being associated with their input. 

What features will it have? 

Our MVP involves user authentication, o-authorization, the ability to create different question types, to see "trending" questions and answer them, visualize results, and up and down vote user comments.

What do you think you can reasonably implement in the time period?

Our MVP seems viable within the week deadline, and we have an ice-box brimming with other features if we finish with time to spare. Top of the list in the icebox are "fuzzy logic" autocomplete to manage duplicate questions, visualizing (mapping) geolocated answer results, and randomly assigned user profile pictures pulled from an api.


* **Object Models.**
